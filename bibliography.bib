@article{Sleeper1990,
abstract = {The Cox proportional hazards model restricts the log hazard ratio to be linear in the covariates. A smooth nonlinear covariate effect may go undetected in this model but can be well approximated by a spline function. A survival model based on data from a clinical trial of primary biliary cirrhosis is developed using regression splines, and the resulting log hazard ratio estimates are compared with those from nonparametric methods. We remove the linear restriction on the log hazard ratio by transforming a continuous covariate into a vector of fixed knot basis splines (B-splines). B-splines are known to produce better-conditioned systems of equations than the truncated power basis when used as interpolants, and show similar behavior when fitting proportional hazards models. We describe the procedures for, and the issues arising in, the estimation and the testing of the B-spline coefficients. Although inference is not well developed for some nonparametric methods that estimate covariate effects, the asymptotic theory for Cox model B-spline estimates is relatively straightforward. An S function for fitting B-splines in Cox regression models is available. {\textcopyright} 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

@article{Gray1992,
abstract = {In this article some flexible methods for modeling censored survival data using splines are applied to the problem of modeling the time to recurrence of breast cancer patients. The basic idea is to use fixed knot splines with a fairly modest number of knots to model aspects of the data, and then to use penalized partial likelihood to estimate the parameters of the model. Test statistics are proposed which are analogs of those used in traditional likelihood analysis, and approximations to the distributions of these statistics are suggested. In an analysis of a large data set taken from clinical trials conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, these methods are seen to give useful insight into how prognosis varies as a function of continuous covariates, and also into how covariate effects change with follow-up time. {\textcopyright} 1992 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

@book{Wood2017,
abstract = {The first edition of this book has established itself as one of the leading references on generalized additive models (GAMs), and the only book on the topic to be introductory in nature with a wealth of practical examples and software implementation. It is self-contained, providing the necessary background in linear models, linear mixed models, and generalized linear models (GLMs), before presenting a balanced treatment of the theory and applications of GAMs and related models. The author bases his approach on a framework of penalized regression splines, and while firmly focused on the practical aspects of GAMs, discussions include fairly full explanations of the theory underlying the methods. Use of R software helps explain the theory and illustrates the practical application of the methodology. Each chapter contains an extensive set of exercises, with solutions in an appendix or in the book's R data package gamair, to enable use as a course text or for self-study.},
